# InstanceAndStaticMethodPractice

Method is used to write the logics in the application. There are two types of methods, Instance method and Static Method. 
Instance method is when we dont have the static modifier. Static method is when we do you the static modifier in the method. 
To access the Instance Method we have to create an object from the class name. To access the static method we have to use the class name.
We can create out own user defined method but JVM does not understand out method. In that case, we have to call our methods in the main method.
JVM only understands the main method.
